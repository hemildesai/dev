I'm an incoming Master's student in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I grew up in Surat, India. After completing my high school, I pursued a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Purdue Unviersity, graduating in December 2016. I went on to work as a Software Engineer at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), helping build backend systems. Next, I worked as a Platform Engineer at a startup called [Roam Analytics](https://roamanalytics.com/), where I helped build a robust platform for Machine Learning experiments and applications on Kubernetes.

Currently, I'm part of a distributed research organization called [FOR.ai](https://for.ai/) where I'm working on a couple of interesting Machine Learning research projects.

My present research interests include **Bayesian Deep Learning**, **Probabilistic Machine Learning**, **Generative Models** and **Computer Vision**.
